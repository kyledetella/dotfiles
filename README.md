dotfiles
========

A collection of my dotfiles & configurations mostly based off of [Evan Hahn's dotfiles](https://github.com/EvanHahn/dotfiles/)

## Setup

```sh
# clone this repo
script/symlink.sh

# if on OSX
script/osx-settings.sh
script/setup

# if on Debian
sudo apt-get install ruby -y

script/packages.rb
```
